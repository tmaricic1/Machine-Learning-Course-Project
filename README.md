# Machine Learning Course Project

This is the course project for my Machine Learning course. The purpose of this project was to make extensions to previous machine learning models that we worked on during the span of the course to improve accuracy. We first tested these extensions using the SciKit Learn and Tensorflow libraries. After confirming that these extensions improved our accuracy, we then coded the algorithms from scratch. The two extensions my partner and I decided on were:

1. Neural Network Dropout
2. Random Forest
